Run grids of models using the spectral synthesis code Cloudy, taking advantage of multiple cores, and then parse the output.

example:

copy cloudy.py and cloudy_util.py to the directory where you want to run the grid from, and then do:

   python cloudy.py

Note you also need a CUBA Haardt-Madau background file.
